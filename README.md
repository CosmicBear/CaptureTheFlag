# CaptureTheFlag

This repo presents and demonstrates my work on capture the flag (penetration testing) challenges. Most challenges will originate from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) or [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu).

Please visit the [wiki-page](https://github.com/CosmicBear/CaptureTheFlag/wiki) to get an overview of the different challenges and see in detail my approach on how I penetrated them.

## Machines

This folder contains a folder for each machine started. Every specific machine folder contains notes, flags, files/data collected. Notes are taken with CherryTree.
